#### Problem Statement
Shopping Lines : Nowadays, in shopping malls we have to wait for the billing in big lines. It assures traffic in a mall and it is a very time-consuming process as well. So, we must design the system that will reduce the time for billing procedure. Hint: Queue Management System.
#### Team
This project prototype is presented by team " Runtime terror " consisting of three members:
- Tanmoyee Roy
- Sandeep Das
- Akanksha Sinha
#### Introduction
Queue management is a set of principles aimed at controlling customer flow and streamlining the queuing experience. A queue management system (QMS) is a set of tools developed to manage and analyze the flow of customers. Queue Management System is madeup out of four key components:
- Population of customers
- Method of arrival
- Service mechanism
- Queue charecteristics 
But we hereby present a more efficient version of QMS. The customer will be having a " Shopify card " which will be generating a unique QR code while registering for the card and the customers will be using that card to reduce their waiting time at the billing counter. Let's see how does it does that in the _working_ section.
#### Working
A customer needs to register himself to generate his shopify card. This card can be generated in any of the shopping malls and can be used in any shopping mall where the facility will be provided since it is a cloud based software. After filling up some basic details like Name, Email ID, phone number and a password, the QR code will be generated and the card with the customer's QR Code will be given to the customer. A database in the cloud will be made which will be containing all the credential information along with the bills. Now in the mall, each and every section like : the groceries section, the Cosmetics section, the women dress section , etc will be having a scanner which the customer will be using to scan the tag of the item that they are buying and also the shopify card after each and every item scanning. This will reduce the time at the billing counter and also there won't be any rush in the mall. Each and everytime a item is being scanned along with the QR code, the database keeps updating the items added. Finally after completing shopping, when the customer will reach the billing counter, all he needs to do is to give the items for packaging and a final swipping of his shopify card which will automatically show the details and the final bill. The customer just needs to pay off the bill in whichever way he wants to i.e by card or by cash or by UPI ID. One's the payment is done, the cashier will swipe out the shopify card and the database will automatically get updated without deleting the previous list and again initialising the database to a new and fresh one. 
#### Setup
_Step 1_: Map out the processes, and think of the controls
_Step 2_: Create documentation for the procedures & protocols
_Step 3_: Buy gagets accordingly 
_Step 4_: Proper planing of establishment
_Step 5_: Buying cloud space and customising it
_Step 6_: Implementation of the idea
#### Advantages
The advantages of the following system can be:
* Reduces the waiting time of a customer
* Reduces the crowd near the billing counter 
* Efficient use of resources
* Greater access of data
* Data security
* performance optimization
* Scaling the business is much easier
* Low maintainance cost
#### Disadvantages
As with every new technology with so many benifits, there are some demerits also, which are as follows:
* Preparing employees for cloud-based QMS
* security risks
* Initial establishment cost is high
